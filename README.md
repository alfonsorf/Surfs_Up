# Surfs Up
## Overview
In this module I continued working with databases and queries, but this time did it all through Jupyter Notebook using SQLAlquemy and SQLite. The purpose of this analysis was to help find weather data in Oahu, such as temperature and precipitation, for the months of June and December to help a group of investors decide if a ice cream and surf shop would be a good business idea. 

## Results
Based on the analysis I performed these are 3 major points I determined:
- The average temperature in Oahu is in the low 70's for both June and December, with less than a 4 degree difference between the two months.
- The maximum temperature Oahu reached in June was 85째F and in December was 83째F, showing only a 2 degree difference between the two months. 
- The minimum temperature in Oahu in June was 64째F while in December was 56째F, cooler temperatures but still allow surfing.

## Summary
The data from this analysis shows that a surf and ice cream shop would be a success, but this is based only on temperature data of two months. To make a more informed decision I would research the Oahu weather further by finding the precipitation results in June and December, as this could have a big impact even if temperatures are relatively the same year-round. And another query I would make would be to include the weather station activity and use the top 2 or 3 most active stations to try and pinpoint the best location for the surf shop.
